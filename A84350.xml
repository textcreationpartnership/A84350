         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as of our ſelues we are deſtitute of all good things, and vtterly voide of all neceſſary helpes to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Lord our God of his owne free mercie and goodneſſe offereth himſelfe to vs in Chriſt, and in him, he giueth vnto vs in the ſtead of our miſery, al felicity, in the ſtead of our pouerty, the vnſpeakable riches of his grace, he openeth vnto vs in him the treaſures of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that our faith might who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold him, and our hope bee fully fixed vpon him Jn whom it hath pleaſed him that the fulneſſe of his grace ſhould dwell, that from thence we might all draw (as out of a moſt plentifull fountaine) the waters of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. This ſecret and great miſterie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to ſuch onely, whoſe eies the Lord hath opened to ſee light in his light. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince we are taught by faith that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we haue need of, &amp; is wanting in vs, the ſame is laid vp with God for vs in Chriſt: it remaineth that we ſeeke it in him,<note place="margin">Rom 10</note> &amp; with praier craue it of him,</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle therefore to ſhew that true faith cannot be ſeparated from the inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:121328:8"/> of Gods holy name, hath ſet this order that as faith commeth by the Goſpell, ſo by the ſame faith our hearts are ſtirred vp to call vpon the name of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and therefore he ſaith that the ſpirit of adoption which ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in our hearts the witneſſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, raiſeth vp our ſpirits that they dare with boldneſſe ſhew forth their deſires: it ſtirreth vp in vs vnſpeakeable gronings, and cauſeth vs to cry with confidence, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> By the benefit of prayer therefore we attaine to thoſe riches which God hath laide vp in ſtore for vs: for thereby we haue fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acceſſe to God, and boldly entring into the ſanctuarie of heauen, we put him in mind of his promiſes: ſo that now by experience wee feele and finde that to be true indeede, which by the word we did before but onely beleeue: now we enioy thoſe treaſures by Prayer, which by faith wee did before but onely behold in the Goſpell of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Now how neceſſary and profitable this exerciſe of prayer is, appeareth in that the Lord himſelfe witneſſeth our whole ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conſiſt in the calling vpon his name, whereby he is wholly preſent with vs, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his prouidence and fatherly care, by the which he vvatcheth ouer vs: by his power,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:121328:8"/> by the which hee ſuſtaineth and ſuccoureth our weakeneſſe, being euery moment ready to periſh: and by his goodneſſe and mercy, by the which he receiueth vs into fauour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſerably loaden and preſſed down with ſinne. And hereby groweth ſingular reſt and quietneſſe to our conſcience. For when wee haue diſcloſed to him our neceſſity, herein we finde moſt ioyfull and perfect quietneſſe, that none of our euils are hidden from him, whom we are perſwaded to bee both moſt willing and alſo moſt able to helpe vs.</p>
            <p>Now, that our praier may be made in ſuch wiſe as it ought to be, firſt wee muſt ſee that we be in heart and minde no otherwiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, then becommeth thoſe that enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to talke with God, as we are taught Eccl. 28. <hi>Before thou pray, prepare thy ſelfe, and be not as one that tempteth God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt conſider therfore when we pray, in whoſe preſence wee ſtand, to whom wee ſpeake, and what we deſire. We ſtand in the preſence of the Almighty creator of heauen and earth, &amp; all things therein contained, to whoſe eternall Maieſty innumerable thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Angels do aſſiſt, ſerue, and obey: we ſpeake vnto him, who knoweth the ſecrets of our harts: before whom nothing is more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then hypocriſie &amp; diſſimulation: we aske
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:121328:9"/> thoſe things which be moſt for his glory, &amp; the comfort of our conſciences. VVee muſt therefore diligently endeuour our ſelues to remoue all ſuch things as may offend his diuine maieſtie. And firſt, that wee bee free from all worldly cares and fleſhly cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby our minds are carried hither &amp; thither, and being drawne out of heauen, &amp; from the pure beholding of God, are preſſed downe to the earth.</p>
            <p>And here let vs call to mind how vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently we abuſe the great goodneſſe of God, calling vs into familiar talke with him: when we haue not that reuerent feare of his ſacred Maieſtie, that we would haue of an earrhly creature, or a worldly Prince: but ſuffering our hearts to be carried away with wandring thoughts &amp; worldly imaginations, are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe occupied, and forſake him in the midſt of our praiers.</p>
            <p>As God is a Spirit, ſo will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in ſpirit and truth; that is in the inward affections of the heart, and with a true faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnſained kind of worſhip. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as at all other times, hee requireth the heart, ſo ſpecially in the time of praier, when we ſhew our ſelues in his preſence, and enter into communication with him: and therupon when he promiſeth to heare all thoſe that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:121328:9"/> call vpon him, he maketh a reſtraint, &amp; ſaith, that call vpon him in truth. Seeing therefore that the chiefe dutie of praier conſiſteth in the heart, we muſt with our whole hart poure out our praiers vnto God the ſearcher of all harts, &amp; with a ſincere, vnfained and ardent affection &amp; opening of our hart before God, call vpon him, or elſe we ſhall not finde him.</p>
            <p>Let vs know therefore, that none prepare themſelues right to praier, but ſuch as haue a reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t feare of Gods Maieſtie: which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue that come not to it vnburthened of earthly cares and affections.</p>
            <p>And this is that is ment in the Scriptures, by the lifting vp of hands, that wee ſhould remember our ſelues to bee farre off from God, vnleſſe we lift vp our hearts and minds alſo on high. And therefore it is ſaid in the Pſalme; <hi>To thee haue I lifted vp my ſoule.</hi> The Scripture vſeth alſo this manner of ſpeech, <hi>To lift vp praier:</hi> that they that deſire to be heard of God, ſhould not haue their mindes carried away with earthly cogitations and vanitie. And though it be hard to bee ſo bent to praier, but that we ſhall finde that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And this wee are alſo no leſſe bound to doe by commandement, whereby wee are forbidden to take the name of God in vain. For in that we are there forbidden to take the name of God in vaine, we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo to take it and vſe it to his glory gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto him the praiſe of al goodnes, helpe and ſuccour, whiles we aske and looke for the ſame at his hand. Wherefore except we flie to him in our trouble and neceſſitie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we call vpon him for reliefe and ſuccor, we prouoke his difpleaſure no leſſe, then if wee ſhould make vnto our ſelues Jdols, or worſhip ſtrange gods: for in the contempt of euery one of the commandements, we ſhew like contempt and diſobedience to the will of God, and all theſe ſentences which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand vs to call vpon God, doe appertaine vnto this commandement. <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine:</hi> and ſo praier is a worke &amp; chiefe ſeruice belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his commandement. Wee may not therefore thinke that there are no ſinnes, but idolatry, murther, theft, whordome, and ſuch like, but that it is vndoubtedly a great ſinne alſo, not to render this ſeruice to God, that is, not to pray, not to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore if our vnworthines at any time do cry out againſt vs, ſtop or feare vs in ſuch ſort that our conſciences are aſtonied and flie from God: if we doubt whether god hath reſpect to our praiers, groanings, and teares, we muſt ſet before our eies, how that we are commanded, though we be neuer ſo vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and our ſinnes neuer ſo many and great to pray for reconciliation, Gods fauour and forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes. For elſe, whereas God commandeth vs to abſtaine from theft, murther, whordome, &amp;c. we may in like ſort excuſe our ſelues and ſay, that we are vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to obey Gods commandements: great is our iniquity, and manifeſt is our contempt and deſpiſing of God, when we neglect and delay to call for his helpe.

            <p>Of praier there be two parts, petition and thankſgiuing.

Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ioyned thoſe two parts together in one verſe, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50</note> 
               <hi>Call vpon mee in the day of neceſsitie, I wil deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scripture commaundeth vs to vſe both, and that continually. For our neceſſity is ſo great, our life is ſo full of troubles and calamities, and ſo many dangers hang ouer our heades euery moment, that wee haue all cauſe enough, yea euen the moſt holy, with ſighes and groanings continually
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:121328:21"/> to flie vnto God, and call vpon him in moſt humble wiſe. But this we may better perceiue in things pertaining to the ſoule.</p>
            <p>For when ſhall ſo many great ſins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we know our ſelues guilty, ſuffer vs to be without care, and not to craue pardon of God for the ſame? when will Satan giue vs reſt and quietnes, when will he ceaſe to range about, ſeeking whom he may deſtroy? when ſhall our tentations giue vs truce, ſo that we ſhall not need to haſten vnto God for helpe. Finally, the deſire of the kingdome and glory of God, ought to draw vs wholly vnto it, not by fits, but continually that all times ſhould be fit and conuenient for vs to pray. VVherefore not without cauſe we are ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten commaunded to pray continually. And though we be not driuen with like neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie at all times to pray, yet in this caſe Saint <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth vs what we ought to doe, <hi>If any man be heauie or afflicted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let him pray,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let him craue Gods helpe and comfort, <hi>and who ſo is merry, let him ſing:</hi> that is, let him praiſe God.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the benefits and bleſſings of GOD, are large and plentifull towards vs, which way ſoeuer wee turne, that we can neuer want matter and occaſion of praiſe and thankeſgiuing. And ſeeing wee ought
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:121328:21"/> to acknowledge God to bee the author and giuer of all good things, we ſhould alway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame at his hand with thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: for to that end God continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth his good bleſſings and benefits vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, that we ſhould continually ſhew forth his praiſe, &amp; be thankful vnto him for the ſame, and ſo wee render vnto him his due honour. And S. Paul when he ſaith, that they are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the word &amp; prayer, ſignifieth that to vs they are not holy and cleane without the word and prayer: and therefore Dauid ſaith, when he had felt the liberalite of the Lord, that there was put into his mouth a new ſong, that is, a new occaſion of praiſe and thankſgiuing. Whereby hee ſignifieth, that it is a wicked ſilence if wee paſſe ouer any of Gods benefits without praiſe, ſeeing that as often as he doth good vnto vs, ſo often he giueth vs occaſion to ſpeake good of him.</p>
            <p>We ſhould therefore continually, that is, as much as is poſſible, at all times, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; in things as occaſions are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered vnto vs lift vp our prayer vnto God in crauing helpe at his hand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his praiſe, whereby we may both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of him all good things, and alſo praiſe and magnifie his name for all.</p>

            <p>Now concerning the forme and manner of praying, leaſt we ſhould follow our owne fantaſie being of our ſelues ſo blind that we know not how to pray, or what is meete and expedient for vs: the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath ſufficiently inſtructed vs: who as he hath taught vs through the whole Scripture, how and for what things we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:121328:22"/> ought to pray, ſo hath he ſet forth one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Prayer, in the which he hath briefly comprehended all ſuch things as we ought, yea, or in any wiſe may aske of GOD. Wherein he hath expreſſed what is due, pleaſing and acceptable to him, what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for vs, and what he will grant: ſo that there is nothing herein omitted, that might be thought vpon to the praiſe &amp; glory of God, or come into the minde of man for his profit and commodity.<note place="margin">Mar. 6 Luk. 11.</note> And this is that prayer that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt taught his Diſciples, when they asked him how they ſhould pray.</p>
            <p>Whoſoeuer therefore ſhall aske any thing that is not contained in this prayer, they preſume to adde ſomething of their owne to the wiſedome of God, they are not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his will, and they pray without faith, hauing no word of God to warrant them: and therefore they ſhall obtaine nothing. This praier ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is the doctrine of the wiſedome of God, wherein he hath taught whatſoeuer he willed, and willed whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was needfull. Albeit we are not ſo bound to this forme of prayer, that we ſhould not vſe any other kinde of words then the Lord himſelfe heerein hath vſed. For there are elſewhere ſet forth in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:121328:23"/> many ptayers, farre differing from this in words, and yet written by the ſame ſpirit, and very profitably to bee vſed of vs. And many praiers alſo are continually vttered of the faithfull by the ſame ſpirit, which varie from the ſame in words.

And ſometimes, when they ſee thy glorie more put backe then it was wont to bee, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in themſelues, or in any other, then are they much more diſquieted and vexed.</p>

Not that thy children doe not vſe their tongues and words, in praying to thee: for they doe vſe their tongues, ſpeech, and words, to ſtirre vp their inward deſire and feruencie of the mind, ful well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that elſe we were a plaine mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of thee, to pray with lips and tongues onely, Oh that I might feele now thy ſpirit ſo to affect mee, that both with heart and mouth, I might hartily and in faith pray vnto thee.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the things that are to bee prayed for, thy children know that the prayer taught by thy Sonne moſt ſurely and plainly doth containe the ſame and therefore they often vſe it; firſt aſking of thee their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:121328:27"/> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father through Chriſt, that thy name might euery where be had in holineſſe and praiſe: then that thy kingdome by regeneration and the miniſtery of the Goſpel might come: &amp; ſo thirdly, that willingly, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perpetually, they might ſtudy to doe, yea doe indeed, thy will with thy holy and heauenly Angels, and ſpirits. Theſe things they ſeeke &amp; pray for, namely, thy kingdome and thy righteouſneſſe, before any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefit.</p>
            <p>After which petitions, becauſe all things, yea euen the benefits of this preſent life doe come from thee, they doe godly deſire the ſame vnder the name of dayly bread, being inſtructed of thy wiſdome, that after ſpirituall benefits to aſke corporall, is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely vnto thy children: which know both ſpirituall and corporall to come from thy mercy.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:121328:27"/>
            <p>In the other petitions, they pray for things to bee taken from them; beginning with forgiueneſſe of ſins, which were impudently prayed for, if that their hearts were not ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that they could forgiue all things to all men. For their part, they adde their profeſſion, that is Charitie, wherby they profeſſe that they haue forgiuen all offences done to them.</p>
            <p>Howbeit becauſe it is not enough to haue pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that wh ch is paſt, except they be preſerued from new offences, they pray thee, not to leade them into temptation by permitting them to the peruerſe ſuggeſtions of Satan; but rather to deliuer them from his importunitie and power, vnderſtanding Satan the author of all euill. Oh (deare God) that thou wouldeſt endue mee with thy ſpirit of grace and praier, with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121328:28"/> thy children accordingly, to make this prayer alwaies whenſoeuer I doe pray.</p>
            <p>As for outward euils, ſo long as they doe not (as it were) inforce thy people to ſinne, in that chriſtian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection doth account the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt thy benefits: thy Son hath not taught thy Church to pray for the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of them, in their praier: for here he hath contained but thoſe things, for the which al Chriſtians general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly may of faith pray at all times.</p>
            <p>It often commeth to paſſe, that exterior euils becauſe they bee not euils indeede, that is, they bee not againſt Gods grace in vs, therefore they cannot of faith be praied for, to be taken away: for thy children, that haue faith, doe alwaies preferre thy iudgement, before their owne. The which iudgement, when they know
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:121328:28"/> by that which hapneth to them, they ſubmit themſelues therto wholy: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſpirit make his vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gronings to helpe their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by prayer, not to haue them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, but that they might haue ſtrength and patience, to beare the burden accordingly. Which burden, if it bee to heauie in the bitter ſenſe and feeling therof they in their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doe complaine ſomething rather then pray to haue it taken away, as our Sauiour did in the garden, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee added to his complaint: <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So doe thy people in al their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints adde, <hi>not as wee will but as thou wilt.</hi> For they are taught by thy ſpirit, no otherwiſe to pray for the taking away of corporall euils, either from themſelues, or from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vnleſſe they by the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doe certainely ſee the ſame to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:121328:29"/> make to thy glorie: as did thine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles &amp; ſeruants, when abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and without condition, they did aſke health or miracle for any, when they healed or raiſed the dead by praier: for they knew nothing can be better then when it is according to thy will. Oh that I might alwaies know thy will in all things, and for euer apply my ſelfe thereto.</p>
            <p>Hereof it commeth that thy ſaints and deere children, which loue their neighbours as themſelues, doe yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in their praiers aſke vengeanes of ſome (as wee may reade in the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in praying and talking with thee, they ſee by thy holie ſpirit (for without it is no true prayer) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thy iudgements vpon ſome, which they perceiue to ſin to death, and therefore ought not to be praied for, becauſe thy glorie cannot be ſet
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:121328:29"/> forth as it ſhould bee, without their deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Thy will is alwaies beſt, and the thing wherto they frame all their deſires. Therefore, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that it is decreed with thee, ſuch &amp; ſuch by their deſtruction to ſet foorth more mightily thy glory, how ſhould they but deſire and pray for the ſame, and write as <hi>Dauid</hi> hath done, that the godly, in reading and weighing ſuch prayers, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, &amp; the vngodly be afraid: elſe when that they perceiue not ſo manifeſtly the determined iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, they in their prayers doe moſt heartely pray for them, as <hi>Samuell</hi> did for <hi>Saul, Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:121328:30"/> alwaies preferre thy glorie aboue all things, through Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>Now, though thy children doe know that thy will cannot but bee done, and nothing can be done, but that thou of thine owne will haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to doe, although no man ſhould deſire the ſame, yet are they earneſt and frequent in praier: firſt, to render obedience to thee, which requireſt prayer as a ſpirituall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to thee: ſecondly, becauſe thou haſt ordained praier to bee as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument and meane, by the which thou workeſt things with thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready decreed and determined.</p>
            <p>Thy children doe vſe praier, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee their ſeruice, if it ſhall pleaſe thee to vſe the ſame: and as they doe eat and drinke, which is a meane or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of thee for the conſeruation of their life, not looking thereby to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:121328:30"/> lengthen their daies aboue their bonds which already thou haſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, but as it becommeth them, to vſe the meanes, which thou haſt ordained to ſerue thy prouidence: ſo doe they (as men herein not curious to know thy prouidence further then thou, reueileſt it) vſe prayer as a mean by the which thou art accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to worke many of thy childrens deſires, that according to thy good will, thou maieſt vſe the ſame.</p>
            <p>They doe not thinke a mutability in thee (for thou art God, and art not changed: with thee there is no vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe) and therfore they pray not as men which would haue thy deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and ordinances (which are in moſt wiſdome and mercy) to bee altered, but rather that they might ſubmit their wils to thine, and make them more able to beare thy will and pleaſure.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:121328:31"/>
            <p>They know thou haſt promiſed to help them calling vpon thee: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they doubt not but ſo thou wilt doe, and therefore pray according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</p>

               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:121328:106"/>
               <p>Grant therefore deare Father, for thy Chriſts ſake, to me a moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretch, thy grace and ſpirit to be effectuall in me, that daily I may accuſtome my ſelfe to deny my will in more eaſie and pleaſant things of this life, that when need ſhal be, I may come vnto thee with a reſigned will, alwaies ſtedfaſtly expecting thy mercy, and in the meane ſeaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually obeying thee with readines and willingnes, doing whatſoeuer may moſt pleaſe thee through Chriſt our Lord, who liueth with thee, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Then ſhould we liue in longing for that which now we moſt loath. Oh helpe vs, and grant that wee being ignorant of things to come, and of the time of our death (which to thee is certaine) may ſo loue and finiſh our iourny here, that we may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and then depart, when our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting may make moſt to thy glory and our comfort through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>What is this life but a ſmoake, a vapour, a ſhadow, a warfare, a bubble of water, a word, graſſe, a flower? That thou ſhalt die, it is moſt certaine, but the time no man can tel when. The longer in this life
